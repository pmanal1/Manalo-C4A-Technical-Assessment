Finally created a devlog. I wanted to make one now since there wasn't
much to talk about given how little I knew about the languages, the frameworks
and the project. Now that I have some knowledge to work with, I can start
tackling this project bit by bit.

Before I continue, I'll likely format this devlog using one text document,
each entry separated by the date of the entry. The following entries are things
related to this technical assessment that I've done leading up to this point.

Set up the technical assessment in VSCode and created a GitHub repository with an
initial commit.

The last time I used JavaScript was last year when creating a full-stack website
with React as a framework for the front-end. I would need to spend some time learning
and reviewing before I begin actually tackling this project.

I had lots of classwork to focus on this week, and wanted to focus on this and next
week's homework so I have time next week just to focus on this assessment.
