## Purpose

The purpose of keeping a devlog is to help us see all the work you put in when attempting at least 4 tasks either in the frontend or backend folders.  For instance, if you don't know anything about web APIs, express, and node and you decide to attempt the backend tasks.  We would like to see in your devlog how you researched those technologies before starting the tasks.  Another example could be your experience of overcoming a bug that took you 2 days to fix, giving you less time to work on other tasks.

We use this devlog to see how you solve problems you run into as you are developing. Research is an essential component to being a member of our team and it is a great way to learn new things! 

## Structure

You can structure this devlog however you like.  You could keep one file and mark the day and any noteworthy thing to write down.  You could also keep a new file for everyday something noteworthy happens.  You can use markdown, txt, word, etc. as long as we can read and access it.
